            <p class="fuci">The conditions of cinematographic art have changed 
              radically over the past years. On the verge of a material revolution 
              new possibilities of camera and production techniques have emerged 
              that also allow new modes of narration and image languages. FUTURE 
              CINEMA is <span class="cool">the first major international</span> exhibition of current art 
              practice in the domain of video, film, computer and web based installations 
              that embody and anticipate new cinematic techniques and modes of 
              expression. 
            <p class="fuci"> The exhibition offers the context for bringing together 
              for the first time a large number of highly significant cinematic 
              installation, multimedia and net based works that have been produced 
              by both young and established international artists working in this 
              field. At the same time the exhibition will premier numerous new 
              works, some specially commissioned for this exhibition, and a few 
              actually produced at the ZKM | Institute for Visual Media. <span class="cool">A strong 
              curatorial emphasis</span> will be on installations that diverge from the 
              conventional on the wall mounted and projected screen format and 
              which explore more immersive and technologically innovative environments 
              such <span class="cool">as multi-screen, panoramic, dome projection, shared multi-user, 
              and on-line</span> configurations. Another central focus will be on works 
              that explore creative approaches to the design of interactive non-linear 
              narrative content. 
            <p class="fuci"> Besides the installation works, the ZKM will use 
              its Media Theater to present a number of performances and changing 
              installations. While the exhibition itself will focus on current 
              artistic practice in the field of digitally expanded cinema, a <span class="cool">major 
              catalogue</span> will be published that documents the historical trajectory 
              of those many and variegated cinematic experiments that prefigure, 
              inform and contextualize our current cinematic condition. 
            <p class="fuci"> The history of cinema is a history of technological 
              experiment, of spectator-spectacle relations, and of production, 
              distribution and presentation mechanisms that yoke the cinema o 
              economic, political and ideological conditions. Above all it is 
              a history of creative exploration of the uniquely variegated expressive 
              capabilities of this <span class="cool">remarkable medium</span>. <br>
              Despite cinema's heritage of technological and creative diversity, 
              it is Hollywood that has come to define its dominant forms of production 
              and distribution, its technological apparatus and its narrative 
              forms. But the current hegemony of the <span class="cool">Hollywood model of movie 
              making is about to be questioned</span> by the more radically new potentialities 
              of the digital media technologies, which is why the rise of the 
              video, computer game and location based entertainment industries 
              is such a significant phenomena. These new digital contexts are 
              setting an appropriate platform for the further evolution of the 
              traditions of independent, experimental and expanded avantgarde 
              cinema. 
            <p class="fuci"> Though it is still early in the process, one can 
              identify some of the focal features of this emer-gent domain of 
              the digitally expanded cinema. The technologies of virtual environments 
              point to a cinema that is an immersive narrative space wherein the 
              interactive viewer assumes the role of both cameraperson and editor. 
              And the technologies of computer games and the Internet point to 
              a cinema of distributed virtual environments that are also social 
              spaces, so that the persons present become protagonists in a set 
              of narrative dis-locations. 
            <p class="fuci"> <span class="cool">The digital domain</span> is above all distinguished by 
              it variegated range of new interaction modalities. Needless to say 
              all traditional forms of expression are also interactive to the 
              extent that they must be interpreted and reconstructed in the process 
              of apprehension, but <span class="cool">digital interactivity</span> offers a new direct dimension 
              of user control and involvement in the creative proceedings. The 
              traditional cinema's compulsive spectacle-spectacle relationship 
              will be transformed as the growing spectrum of <span class="cool">input-output technologies</span> 
              and algorithmic production techniques are applied to the digitally 
              expanded cinema. 
            <p class="fuci"> Cinema builds hyper realities, space time constructs 
              that are conjoined to the presence of the spectator in the darkened 
              magical space of the movie-theater. From Cinerama to 3D to Omnimax, 
              the cinema has yearned to construe its fictions in a space of equivalence 
              with the real. The objective, as in many forms of art, is to bind 
              the experience of being to such a place that induces a totality 
              of engagement in the aesthetic and conceptual construct of the work. 
              At the same time the digitally expanded online-cinema offers the 
              <span class="cool">convergence</span> between PC, TV, www and the experience to be dis-located 
              from a place and to make emotional and cognitive experience in various 
              locations. 
            <p class="fuci"> The intention is not a <span class="cool">totalitarian spectacle</span> that 
              overwhelms and belittles the viewer, rather it is an inspiring manifestation 
              that affirms each viewer's unique position and critical relationship 
              to the representation. Furthermore the new networking technologies 
              allow these cultural experiences to extend themselves into virtual 
              social spaces that can constitute a further level of immersion. 
            <p class="fuci"> The accomplished Chilean filmmaker Raul Ruiz has 
              criticized the compulsive attributes of the central conflict theory 
              in the Hollywood cinema (<i>Poetics of Cinema</i>, 1995), and calls 
              for strategies whereby the autocracy of the director and his subjugating 
              optical apparatus can be shifted towards the notion of a cinema 
              that is located in the personally discoverable periphery. How exactly 
              to achieve this is a very pertinent challenge, and solutions are 
              being offered by new methods of visualization and utilization. The 
              biggest challenge for the digitally extended cinema is the conception 
              and design of new narrative techniques that allow the interactive 
              and emergent features of that medium to be fulfillingly embodied. 
              Going beyond the triteness of branching plot options and video game 
              mazes, one approach is to develop modular structures of narrative 
              content which permit an indeterminate yet meaningful numbers of 
              permutations. Another approach involves the algorithmic design of 
              content characterizations that would permit the <span class="cool">automatic generation 
              of narrative sequences</span> that could be modulated by the user. And 
              perhaps the consummate venture is the notion of a digitally extended 
              cinema that is actually inhabited by its audience who then becomes 
              agents of and protagonists in its narrative development. 
            <p class="fuci"> The Future of Cinema can be delineated from two sources. 
              One way is the expansion of e-xisting cinematographic methods and 
              codes into new areas. The other way is the convergence of cinema, 
              TV and net. The classical cinema can be defined as collective experience 
              of one fixed stable projector projecting a moving image on one screen 
              in one room. Therefore each change of one of these factors, for 
              example <span class="cool">multiple screens, panorama screens, moving projections</span>, 
              different rooms, is already an expansion of the contemporary practises 
              of cinema. 
            <p class="fuci"> On the level of the material display of the image 
              many new techniques are also in development. Smart materials are 
              developed which can be new sources of light and colour. New lenses 
              are developed which contain information as a temporal code. In general 
              there is a change from refractive optics to diffractive optics. 
            <p class="fuci"> Especially new results are to be expected from multilocal 
              and multiuser virtual environments, from massive parallel virtual 
              worlds, which can be developed on the basis of the global net. These 
              new communication channels of the net in combination with <span class="cool">GPS-Systems</span>, 
              satellite transmission and <span class="cool">WAP mobile phones</span> are allowing new forms 
              of interactive personal and collective cinema on a digital basis. 
            <p> <span class="fuci">The exhibition will give an overview about 
              future possibilities in this three areas of cinema-tographic research 
              through selected prototypes. The show will be a laboratorium, where 
              scientists and artists <span class="cool">meet, a window</span> into the future. </span>
